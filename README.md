LIBXSMM
=======
Library for small matrix-matrix multiplications targeting Intel Architecture (x86). This initial version of the library is targeting the Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor (an instance of the Intel Many Integrated Core Architecture "MIC") particularly using KNC intrinsic functions.

The code can be compiled to native code which is also usable in an offloaded code region (via a FORTRAN directive or via C/C++ preprocessor pragma). The prerequisite for offloading the code is to compile it to position-independent (PIC) code even when building a static library.

Performance: the presented code is by no means "optimal" or "best-performing" - it just uses Intrinsics. In fact, a well-optimizing compiler may produce better performing code.

Instructions
============
To compile the library run:

```sh
make
```

The interface is produced inside the *include* directory and the library archives are produced inside the *lib* directory. The *mic* subdirectory stores the native library whereas the *intel64* folder contains the hybrid archive containing host and MIC code.

To remove intermediate files use:

```sh
make clean
```

or to remove all generated files including the library interface and archive files:

```sh
make realclean
```

The usual `make install` is simply a shortcut for `make; make clean`.

The library can be configured to accept row-major (default) or column-major order matrices. Change the variable *ROW_MAJOR* inside of the Makefile (1 for row-major, and column-major order otherwise), or build the library in the following way to configure the column-major format:

```sh
make ROW_MAJOR=0
```

The interface of the library (include/xsmm_knc.h) defines the preprocessor symbols *LIBXSMM_ROW_MAJOR* and *LIBXSMM_COL_MAJOR* to mark the storage order the library was built for.

To perform the matrix-matrix multiplication C(M,N) = C(M,N) + A(M,K) \* B(K,N), one of the following two interfaces can be used:

```C
dc_smm_dnn_function_type dc_smm_dnn_function(int M, int N, int K); // if non-zero call (*function)(M, N, K)
void xsmm_dnn(int M, int N, int K, const double* A, const double* B, double* C); // automatic dispatch
```

The values of the matrix sizes (M, N, and K values) can be set by changing the variables inside the Makefile file or by running for example:

```sh
make INDICES_M="2 4" INDICES_N="1" INDICES_K="$(echo $(seq 2 5))"
```

which generates the following (M,N,K) values:

```
(2,1,2), (2,1,3), (2,1,4), (2,1,5),
(4,1,2), (4,1,3), (4,1,4), (4,1,5)
```

More Details
============
The function *dc_smm_dnn_function* helps to amortize the cost of the dispatch when multiple calls with the same M, N, and K are needed. The symbol *xsmm_dnn* is actually a macro that allows to inline the dispatch logic; use *LIBXSMM_DMM* in new code rather than *xsmm_dnn*. The code dispatch uses three levels:

1. Specialized routine,
2. Inlined code, and
3. BLAS library call.

The level 2 and 3 may be supplied by the Intel MKL DIRECT CALL feature. Beside of the generic interface, one can call a specific kernel e.g., *xsmm_dnn_4_4_4*.

Further, the preprocessor symbols *LIBXSMM_MAX_M*, *LIBXSMM_MAX_N*, and *LIBXSMM_MAX_K* are defined each as the largest value of the corresponding parameter sets *INDICES_M*, *INDICES_N*, or *INDICES_K*. The product of the thee values (problem size) determines if the multiplication belongs to level (1) and (2), or if it falls back to level (3) calling the BLAS library linked with LIBXSMM.
