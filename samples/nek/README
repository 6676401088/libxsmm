This directory contains kernels taken from Nek{Box,5000}.  They aim to represent the majority of the matrix-matrix workload.

## stpm
small tensor-product multiple (stpm) replicates the axhelm kernel, which computes the Laplacian with spectral elements.
Usage:
./stpm m n k mode size
The elements are m-by-n-by-k, mode picks the libxsmm interace used, and size scales the number of spectral elements.

## rstr
restriction operator transforms elements from one size to another.  This occurs in multi-grid, the convection operator, and, when the sizes are the same, the local schwarz solves.  
Usage:
./rstr m n k mm nn kk mode size
The inputt elements are m-by-n-by-k and the output elements are mm-by-nn-by-kk.  When m=mm, n=nn, k=kk, this half of a Schwarz solve.
